# SimpleForumBackend
Backend of Simple Forum

The development has not started yet and the mvp is implemented to respond to front end requests. At the moment
this project is not secure, viable or usable outwith a demonstration in any way. The development proper will begin
shortly.

It is designed for use as the backend of https://github.com/GrantFleming/SimpleForum
